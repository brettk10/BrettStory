One day, a kid named Barry was walking down the street and he saw a giant teddy bear. Barry was very freaked out at first, but then the huge Teddy Bear gave him a hug. They walked away together and got lunch at QDoba.
At QDoba, Barry didn't know what to get. He turned to his new bear friend and asked for help. Suddenly, the bear smashed through the ceiling and flew away. At that instant, Barry knew he met a very special bear.
While they were flying, they had a beautiful view of Lake Mendota. They even saw a few other UW Madison students walking on the ice and throwing snowballs. The decided to land on the lake and join them. His new bear friend destroyed everybody in a snowball fight. He accidentally throw some snowballs a little too hard and hurt some Wisconsin students. The bear was sued for a lot of money.
