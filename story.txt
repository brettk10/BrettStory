One day, a kid named Barry was walking down the street and he saw a giant teddy bear. Barry was very freaked out at first, but then the huge Teddy Bear gave him a hug. They walked away together and got lunch at QDoba.
At QDoba, Barry didn't know what to get. He turned to his new bear friend and asked for help. Suddenly, the bear smashed through the ceiling and flew away. At that instant, Barry knew he met a very special bear.
While they were flying, they had a beautiful view of Lake Mendota. They even saw a few other UW Madison students walking on the ice and throwing snowballs. They decided to land on the lake and join them. His new bear friend destroyed everybody in a snowball fight. He accidentally threw some snowballs a little too hard and hurt some Wisconsin students. The bear was sued for a lot of money.
When Barry and his new bear friend showed up to the Madison courthouse, the jury seemed to not be in their favor. Barry feared that he would lose his new friend to jail because he couldn't pay fines because he was a bear with no money. But the jury found that the bear didn't have to pay any money because it was a bear, and Barry and his friend walked away and decided to get lunch at Chipotle this time instead of QDoba.
